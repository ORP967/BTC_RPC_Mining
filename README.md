# BTC_RPC_Mining
Use our Bitcoin Core to mine bitcoins using python3.

I have been looking for any clues on how to mine using RPC's getblocktemplate. For the life of me I just don't have the knowledge. Want to see if we can colaborate in creating one. On the btc_rpc.py file I will put what I have so far.

bitcoin.conf file shows the way I have my setup to connect to my RPC and that it is indexed.
