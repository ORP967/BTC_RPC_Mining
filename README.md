# BTC_RPC_Mining
Use our Bitcoin Core to CPU mine bitcoins using python3.

I changed  Avatar Vanya Sergeev's code (https://github.com/vsergeev/ntgbtminer) to be constantly looking for a new block every 20 seconds or so. If a new block is detected, it downloads a new block template and starts all over again. Currently getting 1.01KH/s.

If anyone can help shorten the code and make it faster would be greatly appreciated.

Just like my OG project, follow the instructions to set up your .conf file.
